# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the visual styling of the Real-time Recording & Translation interface to ensure optimal appearance and usability in both light and dark themes. The enhancement focuses on three key areas: the Audio Input section, the Transcription Text display, and the Translation Text display.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Audio Input Section Visual Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Audio Input section to have a visually distinct and appealing appearance that clearly separates it from other interface elements, so that I can easily identify and interact with audio controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the interface in light theme THEN the Audio Input section SHALL have a subtle background color that provides visual separation without being distracting
2. WHEN viewing the interface in dark theme THEN the Audio Input section SHALL have an appropriately contrasted background that maintains readability
3. WHEN hovering over the Audio Input section THEN there SHALL be a subtle visual feedback indicating interactivity
4. IF the audio visualizer is present THEN it SHALL have adequate padding and spacing from other controls
5. WHEN the section contains multiple controls (input selector, gain slider) THEN they SHALL be properly aligned and spaced

### Requirement 2: Transcription Text Display Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want the transcription text area to be clearly readable with good contrast and visual hierarchy, so that I can easily read the transcribed content in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing transcription text in light theme THEN the text SHALL have high contrast against the background (minimum 4.5:1 ratio)
2. WHEN viewing transcription text in dark theme THEN the text SHALL be easily readable without eye strain
3. WHEN the transcription area is empty THEN there SHALL be a subtle placeholder or visual indicator
4. WHEN text is being added THEN the scrolling behavior SHALL be smooth and automatic
5. WHEN the text area has focus THEN there SHALL be a clear visual indicator
6. IF the text area contains long content THEN the scrollbar SHALL be styled consistently with the theme

### Requirement 3: Translation Text Display Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want the translation text area to be visually distinct from the transcription area while maintaining consistency, so that I can easily differentiate between original and translated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing both transcription and translation areas THEN they SHALL have consistent styling with subtle differentiation
2. WHEN translation is disabled THEN the translation area SHALL have a visual indicator showing its inactive state
3. WHEN viewing in light theme THEN the translation area SHALL complement the transcription area's styling
4. WHEN viewing in dark theme THEN the translation area SHALL maintain the same level of readability as the transcription area
5. WHEN both areas contain text THEN the visual hierarchy SHALL make it clear which is transcription and which is translation

### Requirement 4: Theme Consistency and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want all interface elements to maintain consistent styling and meet accessibility standards, so that the application is comfortable to use for extended periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between light and dark themes THEN all styled elements SHALL transition smoothly
2. WHEN viewing any text element THEN it SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
3. WHEN interacting with any control THEN focus indicators SHALL be clearly visible
4. IF a user has system-level theme preferences THEN the application SHALL respect those preferences
5. WHEN viewing the interface on different screen sizes THEN the styling SHALL remain consistent and readable

### Requirement 5: Visual Feedback and State Indication

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback for different states (recording, idle, error), so that I understand the current status of the recording system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording is active THEN the interface SHALL provide clear visual indicators
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN error states SHALL be visually distinct and attention-grabbing
3. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN there SHALL be subtle hover effects
4. WHEN an element is disabled THEN it SHALL have reduced opacity or other visual indicators
5. WHEN the audio visualizer is active THEN it SHALL have smooth animations that don't distract from the main content

## Design Constraints

- Must maintain compatibility with existing PyQt6 QSS (Qt Style Sheets) system
- Must not break existing functionality or layout
- Must work on both macOS and Windows platforms
- Must support dynamic theme switching without application restart
- Must maintain performance (no heavy CSS animations or effects)

## Success Criteria

- All three sections (Audio Input, Transcription, Translation) have enhanced visual styling
- Styling works correctly in both light and dark themes
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards are met
- User testing confirms improved visual clarity and usability
- No performance degradation from styling changes
